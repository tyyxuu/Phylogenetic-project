Project Description: The genus Prunus, which includes important species such as almonds, cherries, peaches, and plums, plays a critical role in agriculture, ecology, and human history. ITS1 (Internal Transcribed Spacer 1) regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA are widely used in phylogenetic studies due to their high variability and suitability for resolving evolutionary relationships at the genus and species level.

Data resources:ITS1 sequences were obtained from GenBank, including Prunus sp. BSP-2004-2 partial ITS1, isolates A1, A2, and A6. Additional ITS1 sequences from Prunus serrulata var. spontane T-26 (Accession: LC600963.1) and Prunus dulcis cultivar Lauranne (Accession: HF969277.1) were included to provide broader taxonomic context.

## Step 1: Load Required Packages and Data

```r
library(ape)
library(phangorn)

# Load aligned ITS1 sequences
dna <- fasta2DNAbin(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyyxuu/Phylogenetic-project/main/Phylogenetic%20project%20dataset/ITS1-region-aligned.fasta")
print(dna)

# Initial distance matrix using TN93 model
D <- dist.dna(dna, model = "TN93")

# Visualize character composition (for gap inspection)
table(as.character(dna))

# Filter sequences with >50% gaps
dna <- dna[apply(as.character(dna), 1, function(x) sum(x == "-") / length(x)) < 0.5, ]

# Recalculate distance using raw model with pairwise deletion
D <- dist.dna(dna, model = "raw", pairwise.deletion = TRUE)

# Build NJ tree
tre <- tryCatch(nj(D), error = function(e) njs(D))

# Plot NJ tree
plot(tre, cex = 0.6)
title("Neighbor-Joining Tree")

# Convert DNA alignment to phyDat format
dna_phy <- phyDat(dna, type = "DNA")

# Use NJ tree (JC model) as starting tree
tree_init <- nj(dist.dna(dna, model = "JC"))

# Build ML tree using GTR+G+I model
fit <- pml(tree_init, data = dna_phy)
fit_ml <- optim.pml(fit, model = "GTR", optGamma = TRUE, optInv = TRUE, rearrangement = "stochastic")

# Plot ML tree
plot(fit_ml$tree, main = "Maximum Likelihood Tree (GTR+G+I)", cex = 0.6)

# Perform 100 bootstrap replicates
bs <- bootstrap.pml(fit_ml, bs = 100, optNni = TRUE)

# Plot ML tree with bootstrap support (threshold = 50%)

**MrBayes Phylogenetic Analysis Notebook**

**Objective:**
To perform Bayesian phylogenetic inference using MrBayes on an aligned ITS1 region DNA dataset.

---

**Step 1: Prepare the Data**
- Aligned sequences were initially in FASTA format: `ITS1-region-aligned.fasta`
- Converted to NEXUS format using Biopython:

```python
from Bio import AlignIO
alignment = AlignIO.read("ITS1-region-aligned.fasta", "fasta")
for record in alignment:
    record.annotations["molecule_type"] = "DNA"
AlignIO.write(alignment, "ITS1-region-aligned.nex", "nexus")
```

---

**Step 2: Add MrBayes Command Block**
The following block was appended to the end of the `.nex` file:

```nexus
Begin mrbayes;
   set autoclose=yes nowarn=yes;
   lset nst=6 rates=gamma;
   outgroup KX192120.1;
   mcmc ngen=1000000 samplefreq=100 printfreq=1000 diagnfreq=1000 nchains=4 temp=0.2 savebrlens=yes;
   sumt burnin=2500;
End;
```

- `nst=6` uses the GTR model
- `rates=gamma` accounts for rate variation among sites
- `outgroup` designates the sequence used to root the tree
- `ngen=1000000` specifies 1 million MCMC generations
- `samplefreq=100` samples every 100 generations
- `burnin=2500` discards the first 25% of samples

---

**Step 3: Run MrBayes**
In the terminal, the MrBayes program was run from the compiled source directory:

```bash
~/MrBayes/src/mb
```

At the MrBayes prompt:

```mrbayes
execute ITS1-region-aligned.nex
```

---

**Step 4: Output Files**
After completion, MrBayes produces the following:

- `ITS1-region-aligned.nex.run1.p` and `.run2.p`: parameter traces
- `ITS1-region-aligned.nex.run1.t` and `.run2.t`: tree samples
- `ITS1-region-aligned.nex.con.tre`: **consensus tree** with posterior probabilities

---

**Next Steps:**
- Visualize the consensus tree using [FigTree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases)
- Check convergence and posterior summaries
- Optionally re-run analysis with more generations or model refinements

---

**Notes:**
- MrBayes was run on macOS, M1 architecture
- Execution time: approximately 10â€“30 minutes depending on sequence length and hardware
- Future extensions: partitioned models, clock models, or larger datasets
